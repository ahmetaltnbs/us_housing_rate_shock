RESULTS SNIPPETS (paste-ready)

Sample: 51 states (incl. DC). Saiz elasticity coverage: 42 states.

Cross-state heterogeneity in the 1-year cumulative house price response to a mortgage-rate shock is sizeable. The most negative responses are observed in DC, HI, CA, ND, UT, while the most positive responses occur in VT, RI, NC, GA, MI.

In cross-state regressions, the bivariate association between price sensitivity and Saiz elasticity is positive (coef=0.058, SE=0.046, p=0.210; N=42). 
Controlling jointly for Saiz elasticity and permits sensitivity, both coefficients remain positive (Saiz: 0.067, SE=0.045, p=0.133; Permits: 0.007, SE=0.006, p=0.211).

Note: p-values shown in the sensitivity ranking tables are normal-approximation p-values based on the reported t-statistics (HAC/Newey-West standard errors were used in the state time-series regressions).
